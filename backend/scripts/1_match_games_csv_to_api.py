STEP 1: Match CSV Games with Chess.com API Data
================================================

This script matches chess games from CSV files with their corresponding data from the Chess.com API.

Purpose:
--------
Daniel Naroditsky's speedrun games are tracked in CSV files with YouTube URLs and Chess.com game URLs.
This script fetches the full game data (including PGN with move timings) from Chess.com's API
and creates a matched dataset ready for database import.

Input:
------
- CSV files in data/csv/ containing:
  - Column 0: YouTube URL with timestamp (e.g., https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?t=123)
  - Column 1: Chess.com game URL (e.g., https://www.chess.com/game/live/GAME_ID)

Output:
-------
- JSON file (game_matches.json) containing matched game data with:
  - CSV metadata (YouTube URL, timestamps)
  - API game data (PGN, player info, etc.)
  - Match status (FOUND/NOT_FOUND)

Usage:
------
    python 1_match_games_csv_to_api.py
    
Note: Modify the CSV_FILE path in main() to process different speedrun series.
