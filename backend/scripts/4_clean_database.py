STEP 4: Clean Database of Invalid Links
========================================

This script removes Chess.com game URLs that were accidentally added to video_links.

Purpose:
--------
During data processing, sometimes Chess.com game URLs get mixed into the video_links field.
This utility script cleans them out, keeping only YouTube video URLs.

This is a safety/maintenance script that ensures data quality.

Input/Output:
-------------
- Modifies: data/sqlite/chess_positions.db (in-place)
- Updates: video_links column to remove any Chess.com URLs

Detection:
----------
Removes any links matching the pattern:
    https?://(www\.)?chess\.com/game/live/\d+

Usage:
------
