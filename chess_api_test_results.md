# Chess.com API Test Results

## Summary

We successfully tested the Chess.com API to determine if we can access the data needed for the position matching application. Here are our findings:

## What Works ✅

1. **Player Archive Access**: We can successfully access Daniel Naroditsky's game archives
   - API endpoint: `https://api.chess.com/pub/player/senseidanya/games/archives`
   - Returns 16 archive months of games
   - Each archive contains multiple games with full metadata

2. **Game Data Structure**: The API provides comprehensive game data including:
   - Game URLs
   - PGN data (when accessible)
   - Game metadata
   - Timestamps

## What Doesn't Work ❌

1. **Direct Game Access**: Individual game endpoints return 404 errors
   - `https://api.chess.com/pub/game/{game_id}` → 404
   - `https://api.chess.com/pub/game/{game_id}/pgn` → 404

2. **Game ID Mismatch**: The game IDs from the CSV don't match the format in the archives
   - CSV game IDs: `5640593191`, `6435049568` (10 digits)
   - Archive game IDs: `53075994517`, `53076587107` (11 digits)

## Sample Archive Data

From the most recent archives, we found games like:
- `https://www.chess.com/game/live/53075994517`
- `https://www.chess.com/game/live/53076587107`
- `https://www.chess.com/game/live/53076600405`

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Archive-Based Approach
- Access games through player archives instead of direct game IDs
- Search through all available archives to find matching games
- This approach works but requires more complex searching

### Option 2: Alternative Data Sources
- **Lichess API**: More open and accessible
- **Manual PGN Download**: Download games directly from Chess.com interface
- **Chess Database APIs**: Use other chess databases

### Option 3: Web Scraping
- Directly scrape game pages (though this may violate terms of service)
- More complex but potentially more reliable

## Next Steps

1. **Try Lichess API**: Test if Lichess has similar games or if Daniel Naroditsky has games there
2. **Archive Search**: Implement a comprehensive search through all available archives
3. **Manual Verification**: Check if the CSV game IDs correspond to actual accessible games
4. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a different chess database or manual data collection

## Conclusion

The Chess.com API is partially accessible, but the specific games from the CSV may not be available through the public API. The archive-based approach shows promise, but would require significant development to search through all available data.
